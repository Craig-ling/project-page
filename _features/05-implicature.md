An implicature is an inference obtained from contextual information by a listener after interpreting a sentence from a speaker. An example would be if someone hears the utterance "some of the stores are closed". An implicature obtained from this utterance is that not all of the stores are closed. This is due to the generous interpretation of the utterance and not due to the fundamental meaning of the words. It could still be true that all of the stores are closed, it would not invalidate the original utterance. The ability to simulate these kinds of implicatures is simulated in this program by attempting to calculate, using probabilistic functions and probability weights, the implicatures from sentences containing natural language disjunction ('or') and the quantifier 'nobody'.
