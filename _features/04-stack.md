Mobile application for Android. Two words are scrambled and each character is pushed onto a stack data structure. The top of the stack is visible and the user must drag and drop the characters into one of two areas to unscramble the words. The user can undo their placements and retry indefinitely. The characters are pushed onto and popped off the stack as needed. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Craig-ling/WordStack)
