This program uses a Markov Chain (MC) to generate text. First, a directed graph with edge weights that represent probabilities is created by scanning a text file as input. Each node of the graph holds a word value. Using this data the program then generates text based on the graph generated from the input text. The user is able to input their own text file in the command line or select from existing text files available. [GitHub Repository](https://www.github.com)
