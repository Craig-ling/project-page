By using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, the program demonstrates various NLP (Natural Language Processing) concepts. Sentences
are tokenized and tagged. Demonstrates how the same word can have a different category tag depending on the word context. Constructs a context free grammar and uses a parser to determine if certain sentences can be generated by the grammar. Shows how some grammars are ambiguous. Lastly, modifies a grammar to remove recursion. [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/Craig-ling/ec8370cd89559335942f33bfd1cc4ae9)
