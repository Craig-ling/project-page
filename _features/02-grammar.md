The program demonstrates various NLP (Natural Language Processing) concepts by using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. Sentences
are tokenized and tagged. There is a demonstration pertaining to how the same word can have a different category tag depending on the syntax. A context free grammar is constructed and a parser is used to determine if certain sentences can be generated by the grammar. Shows how some grammars are ambiguous. Lastly, modifies a grammar to remove recursion. [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/Craig-ling/ec8370cd89559335942f33bfd1cc4ae9)
