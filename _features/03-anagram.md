A mobile application for Android. The user is provided with a random word and must think of anagrams of the word with another letter added. However, the anagram can't contain a substring of the provided word. A dictionary is read from a text file. Every word that is an anagram will be equal in length and be identical when the letters are sorted. The sorted character strings can then be keys of a hash map and the anagrams are stored in the appropriate key location. Example: If the provided word is "did" then an anagram with an extra letter is "died". [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/Craig-ling/f2a1eff3194cfd9858ca20aeef0a4031)
